# cyrusmuter
Welcome to a mute bot I created with the help of my amigos over at the Discord.js discord!
## big thanks to them for being amazing
anyways it's pretty simple
step 1: clone/download whatever 
step 2: go into index.js
step 3: change the prefix (line 3) to whatever you want
step 4: change the member you want to mute id (line 15) to whoever you want
step 5: pop your discord bot token (line 39)

# all done!
